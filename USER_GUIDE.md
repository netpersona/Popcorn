## Overview

Popcorn creates cable TV-style movie channels from your Plex media library. It automatically generates:
- **Genre-based channels** (Action, Comedy, Drama, etc.) based on your movies
- **Seasonal holiday channels** (Cozy Halloween, Scary Halloween, Christmas)
- **24-hour schedules** with movies playing back-to-back
- **TV guide interface** for browsing what's "on air"

---

## Prerequisites

Before installing Popcorn, you'll need:

1. **A Plex Media Server** running with a movie library
2. **Docker** (for Docker installation) - [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
   - OR **Python 3.11+** (for direct installation)
3. **Network access** to your Plex server
4. **Plex authentication token** (instructions below)

---

## Getting Your Plex Credentials

### Step 1: Get Your Plex URL

Your Plex URL is typically:
- **Local network**: `http://192.168.1.100:32400` (replace with your server's IP)
- **Remote access**: `https://YOUR-SERVER-ID.plex.direct:32400`

To find your server IP:
1. Open Plex Web App
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Network
3. Note the IP address shown

### Step 2: Get Your Plex Token

#### Method 1: Using Plex Web App (Easiest)
1. Open a movie in Plex Web App
2. Click the three dots (‚ãÆ) ‚Üí "Get Info"
3. Click "View XML"
4. Look in the URL bar for `X-Plex-Token=XXXXX`
5. Copy everything after the equals sign

#### Method 2: Using Browser Developer Tools
1. Open Plex Web App in your browser
2. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
3. Go to the Console tab
4. Type: `localStorage.getItem('myPlexAccessToken')`
5. Press Enter and copy the token (without quotes)

#### Method 3: Using Plex API
1. Sign in at https://www.plex.tv/sign-in
2. Navigate to: https://plex.tv/devices.xml
3. Find your server in the XML and look for `token="YOUR_TOKEN"`

### Step 3: Get Your Plex Client Name (Optional, for Roku playback)

To play movies directly on a Plex client (like Roku):
1. Make sure your Plex client is running and connected to your server
2. The client name is usually the device name (e.g., "Roku Living Room")
3. You can see available clients in Popcorn at: Settings ‚Üí View Available Clients

---

## Installation Methods

### Unraid Installation

If you're running Unraid, see the dedicated **[UNRAID_SETUP.md](UNRAID_SETUP.md)** guide for:
- Installing from Community Applications
- Manual template installation
- Unraid-specific configuration
- Troubleshooting on Unraid

### Docker Installation (Recommended)

Docker is the easiest way to run Popcorn. It handles all dependencies automatically.

#### Step 1: Build the Docker Image

```bash
# Navigate to the Popcorn directory
cd /path/to/popcorn

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t popcorn .
```

This will take a few minutes to download dependencies and build the image.

#### Step 2: Run the Container

**Basic setup (without Plex):**
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name popcorn \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  -e SESSION_SECRET="your-random-secret-key-change-this" \
  popcorn
```

**Full setup (with Plex connection):**
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name popcorn \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  -e SESSION_SECRET="your-random-secret-key-change-this" \
  -e PLEX_URL="http://192.168.1.100:32400" \
  -e PLEX_TOKEN="your-plex-token-here" \
  -e PLEX_CLIENT="Roku Living Room" \
  -v popcorn-data:/app \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  popcorn
```

**Environment Variables Explained:**
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Random string for session security (required)
- `PLEX_URL` - Your Plex server URL (required for Plex features)
- `PLEX_TOKEN` - Your Plex authentication token (required for Plex features)
- `PLEX_CLIENT` - Name of your Plex playback device (optional, for direct playback)

#### Step 3: Access Popcorn

Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

Or from another device on your network:
```
http://YOUR-SERVER-IP:5000
```

#### Docker Management Commands

```bash
# Stop Popcorn
docker stop popcorn

# Start Popcorn
docker start popcorn

# View logs
docker logs popcorn

# Remove container
docker rm -f popcorn
```

#### Updating Popcorn (Docker)

When running in Docker, Popcorn will automatically detect updates but won't apply them automatically (Docker best practice). To update:

**Step 1: Check for Updates**
1. Go to Settings (admin only)
2. Click "Check for Updates"
3. If an update is available, you'll see: "Running in Docker: Please pull the latest image to update"

**Step 2: Pull and Restart**
```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull netpersona/popcorn:latest

# Stop and remove the old container
docker stop popcorn
docker rm popcorn

# Start with the new image (use your original docker run command)
docker run -d \
  --name popcorn \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  -e SESSION_SECRET="your-secret-here" \
  -e PLEX_URL="http://192.168.1.100:32400" \
  -e PLEX_TOKEN="your-token" \
  -v popcorn-data:/app \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  netpersona/popcorn:latest
```

**Note:** Your database and settings are preserved in the volume, so you won't lose any data.

### Direct Python Installation

If you prefer not to use Docker:

#### Step 1: Install Python Dependencies

```bash
# Make sure you have Python 3.11+ installed
python --version

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
export SESSION_SECRET="your-random-secret-key"
export PLEX_URL="http://192.168.1.100:32400"
export PLEX_TOKEN="your-plex-token"
export PLEX_CLIENT="Roku Living Room"
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:SESSION_SECRET="your-random-secret-key"
$env:PLEX_URL="http://192.168.1.100:32400"
$env:PLEX_TOKEN="your-plex-token"
$env:PLEX_CLIENT="Roku Living Room"
```

Or create a `.env` file:
```
SESSION_SECRET=your-random-secret-key
PLEX_URL=http://192.168.1.100:32400
PLEX_TOKEN=your-plex-token
PLEX_CLIENT=Roku Living Room
```

#### Step 3: Run the Application
